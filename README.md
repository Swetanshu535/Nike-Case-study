# Nike-Case-study
Nike Case study contains a dataset where few questions are used to handle dashboards 

ðŸš€ Just completed an exciting project analyzing Nike product data! ðŸŽ‰

I had the opportunity to work with a rich dataset containing key metrics such as product_name, product_id, listing_price, sale_price, discount, brand, rating, and reviews. The objective was to dive deep into the data to extract meaningful insights and present them through an interactive and insightful dashboard.

Some key questions I explored during this project include:

Total Listing Price â€“ I aggregated the listing prices to get an overview of the total value of products offered.
Total Sales Price â€“ By calculating the total sales price, I could highlight the potential revenue generated from these products.
Product Name and Listing Price â€“ I displayed product names alongside their respective listing prices, offering clarity on the pricing landscape across the brand's catalog.
Product ID and Discount â€“ To understand the discounts offered, I mapped each product ID with its corresponding discount percentage, which gave insights into promotional strategies.
Product Name and Total Rating â€“ I showcased the cumulative rating for each product, helping to spotlight customer satisfaction across different items.
I designed the dashboard to be fully interactive, allowing users to filter data and gain customized insights based on specific product categories, pricing ranges, or customer reviews. It was fascinating to see how the data visualization highlighted trends and outliers, making the decision-making process more intuitive for users.

This project was an incredible learning experience and further honed my data analysis skills, especially in areas such as data aggregation, filtering, and dashboard creation. It also reinforced the importance of making data insights visually appealing and actionable. Iâ€™m thrilled with the outcome and excited about the prospect of working on more projects like this in the future!
